                    Owner and Data Controller
                    Types of Data collected

                    there are: Cookies; Usage Data; payment data.
                    Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of
                    this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.
                    Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically
                    when using this Application.
                    Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to
                    provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases
                    where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to
                    communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.
                    Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
                    Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of
                    third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required
                    by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie
                    Policy, if available.
                    Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this
                    Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
                    Mode and place of processing the Data
                    Methods of processing
                    The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                    modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.
                    The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational
                    procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some
                    cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation
                    of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external
                    parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT
                    companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The
                    updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
                    Legal basis of processing
                    The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
                    Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
                    Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
                    without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
                    apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                    provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                    pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                    processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                    official authority vested in the Owner;
                    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
                    third party.
                    In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
                    requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

                    <p>Place</p>
                    The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                    involved in the processing are located.

                    Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
                    country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
                    Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
                    Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
                    European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up
                    by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to
                    safeguard their Data.

                    If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this
                    document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
                    Retention time
                    Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
                    collected for.
                    Therefore:
                    Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and
                    the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.

                    Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access,
                    the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
                    enforced after expiration of the retention period.

                    <p>The purposes of processing</p>
                    The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Services, as well as for

                    management, e-commerce, payment processing – that imply the collection and handling of Personal
                    Data.
                    Some of these services work through geographically distributed servers, making it difficult to
                    determine the actual location where the Personal Data are stored.
